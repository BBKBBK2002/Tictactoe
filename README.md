# TicTacToe Game
  *Welcome to play a tictactoe game with the computer!*

  When you run the program and play tic-tac-toe, it's like this：
  ![tictactoeUI](https://github.com/Juliecodestack/Tictactoe/blob/master/tictactoeUI.png)

# Usage
  ```
  git clone git@github.com:Juliecodestack/Tictactoe.git   
  cd Tictactoe  
  python tictactoe.py
  ```

  **Requirement:**
  Please put `tplus.py` in the same file folder with `tictactoe.py`, for it contains the functions `tictactoe.py` needs to call.

# Credits
  I got inspired to write this program after reading [Al Sweigart ](https://github.com/asweigart)'s "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python ".
  Many Thanks to @asweigart. His book helped me get more interested in Python and programming.

  Tictactoe is a good program for Python beginners to pratice.

# Review
  It's a lot fun to "teach" the computer to play Tictactoe and then play with the smarter "computer student"!

  Enjoy it!
