  *Welcome to play a tic-tac-toe game with the computer!*

  When you run the program and play tic-tac-toe, it's like thisï¼š

  python tictactoe.py
  ```

  **Requirement:**
  Please put `tplus.py` in the same file folder with `tictactoe.py`, for it contains the functions `tictactoe.py` needs to call.

# Credits
  I got inspired to write this program after reading [Al Sweigart ](https://github.com/asweigart)'s "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python ". Many Thanks to @asweigart. His book helped me get more interested in Python and programming. You can find the Tictactoe code example in this book. Tictactoe is a good program for Python beginners to pratice. If you're interested in it, you can study my code and Al Sweigart's code example, and maybe you will get your own idea to write a new program.
  
  It's a lot fun to "teach" the computer to play Tictactoe and then play with the smarter "computer student"!

  Enjoy it!
