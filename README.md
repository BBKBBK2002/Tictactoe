# Credits
  I got inspired to write this program after reading [Al Sweigart ](https://github.com/asweigart)'s "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python ".
  Many Thanks to @asweigart. His book helped me get more interested in Python and programming.

  Tictactoe is a good program for Python beginners to pratice.

# Review
  It's a lot fun to "teach" the computer to play Tictactoe and then play with the smarter "computer student"!

  Enjoy it!
